Design decisions: First of all, make sure that "algs4.jar" is included in the build path.
If compilation errors occur due to "class not found," I have put it in the lib folder so that 
whoever is marking this assignment can add it directly. My design utilizes an enum type for the city name, 
as enums have an associated integer number that can be used to represent vertices in a digraph much easier. 
Thus, in "a2_out.txt", the names of the cities are the enum representations, which lacks spaces and dots in the name.
i.e. "St. Louis" becomes "STLOUIS"

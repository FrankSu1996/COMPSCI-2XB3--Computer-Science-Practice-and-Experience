3.1:
	The type of graph that should be used to solve this problem is a directional graph, also 
	known as a DiGraph. This is because the assignment specifications mentioned that the connections 
	listed in "connectedCities.csv" are unidirectional, meaning that edges connecting nodes are one-way. 
	The nodes/vertices in the graph represent individual cities, while edges represent a unidirectional connection
	between two cities.
